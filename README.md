# tic-tac-toe

* This is a Ruby command line implementation of Tic Tac Toe
* I'm looking forward to looking at other solutions for ideas on how to improve this. Specifically:
    * Efficiently mapping user input to the instance variables that represent the board
    * Checking for a win - 1) both "three in a row" logic, and 2) How to characterize all of the winning plays (top row, middle row, diagonal, etc.)
* This was also my first time using rubocop, which is humbling and a little frustrating!

P.S. - I really liked using an `until` loop
